## How to add a new task?

By default, you just need to paste the live url, and the other configuration items will be parsed automatically, you don't need to fill them in manually. If the url is not parsed immediately, please wait for a few seconds, if it is still not parsed successfully, please check whether the url format is correct and whether the network is smooth.

The url format of each platform is different, only the correct url format can be parsed, the url format can be viewed on the Platform page.

Some platforms need to fill in the cookie value to monitor successfully, check the Platform page to see whether the cookie value is required.

The following features are now supported:

- Automatic transcoding to MP4 format
- Automatic cutting when the file is of a certain size or the playback length meets certain conditions
- Some platforms require cookie configuration
- Customise the file name generated by the download
- Custom proxies
- Custom storage path
- Custom downloader (It is better to use the default downloader, not every downloader supports all platforms.)

## How to get the cookie value?

1. Open Developer Tools: In the page where you want to get the cookie, press F12 or Ctrl+shift+I or follow the steps below to open Developer Tools.
