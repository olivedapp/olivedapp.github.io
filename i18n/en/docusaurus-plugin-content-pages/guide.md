## Task List

### Live URL

By default, you just need to paste the live url, and the other configuration items will be parsed automatically, you don't need to fill them in manually. If the url is not parsed immediately, please wait for a few seconds, if it is still not parsed successfully, please check whether the url format is correct and whether the network is smooth.

The url format of each platform is different, only the correct url format can be parsed, the url format can be viewed on the Platform page.

Some platforms need to fill in the cookie value to monitor successfully, check the Platform page to see whether the cookie value is required.

The following features are now supported:

- Automatic transcoding to MP4 format
- Automatic cutting when the file is of a certain size or the playback length meets certain conditions
- Some platforms require cookie configuration
- Customise the file name generated by the download
- Custom proxies
- Custom storage path
- Custom downloader (It is better to use the default downloader, not every downloader supports all platforms.)

### Snapshot

Clicking on "Snapshot" will provide detailed information about the current live broadcast, which can be used when providing feedback on issues.

### Post Commands

The post-command is essentially a script file that will be executed upon the completion of recording, to meet certain customized requirements.  
Clicking "test run" will simulate the execution of the entered post-command.

On Windows platform, post-command is used as a bat script:

- `%ffmpeg%` is used to call ffmpeg.
- `%record%` is used to obtain the absolute path of the recorded file.

```sh
# split a video file every 60 seconds
%ffmpeg% -i "%record%" -c copy -f segment -segment_time 60 -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0 "%record%_%%d.mp4"
```

```sh
# move a video file to a target directory 
for %%a in ("%record%") do set filename=%%~nxa
echo %filename%
# C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\olivedpro_downloads\ is the target directory 
move %record% "C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\olivedpro_downloads\%filename%"
```

On Mac platform, post-command is used as a bash script:

- `$ffmpeg` is used to call ffmpeg.
- `$record` is used to obtain the absolute path of the recorded file.

```sh
# split a video file every 60 seconds
$ffmpeg -i "$record" -c copy -f segment -segment_time 60 -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0 "$record""_%d.flv"
```

```sh
# move a video file to a target directory 
mv "$record" /Users/mac/Downloads/
```
